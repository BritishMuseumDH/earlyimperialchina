intro=Belief in an afterlife was important in Chinese society. It was expected that people would make offerings to their ancestors so that they would help those on Earth.  This took the form of worship at the ancestor's tomb. <br><br>Even the emperor had to make offerings to ensure a good year's harvest or protect the population from floods. If there was a natural disaster then the people could rebel because it was seen as a sign that he had failed in his role as <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/son.html','son')">'Son of Heaven'</a></font></u> and could be replaced. 

&explore=This model is based on an imperial tomb from the Han dynasty, near Xi'an. The tomb site has a central imperial tomb and is surrounded by smaller tombs of those who worked closely with the emperor. The siting of imperial tombs was based on <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/g/geomancy.html','geom')">geomancy</a></font></u>. In later dynasties a special compass was used to find the most <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/auspicious.html','ausp')">auspicious</a></font></u> site by measuring certain geographical features such as hills and water around the proposed site. <br><u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/imperial_tombs.html','impe')">Imperial tombs</a></font></u> often had models of foreigners along the approach to the tomb to show how much land the Chinese controlled. In the Song dynasty it also reflected their dependence on <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/d/diplomacy.html','dipl')">diplomacy</a></font></u>, as they were militarily weaker than previous dynasties.

&spiritway=The <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/spirit_way.html','spir')"><b>Spirit Way</b></a></font></u> was the approach along a straight road to imperial tombs only. In the later dynasties figures were placed either side of the road to protect the deceased. These were arranged to face inwards along the Spirit Way to the tomb. Their height could vary from being about 1 metre tall to being over 3 metres tall. 

<br><br>Inside the tomb there would have been more figures made from ceramic. Three main types of guardians were earth spirits, <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/lokapala.html','loka')">lokapalas</a></font></u> and representations of a people in military or civilian dress. The earth spirit is from Daoism, the lokapala is from Buddhism and the representation of an official is from Confucianism. Both the earth spirit and lokapala looked incredibly fierce. They were to stop the dead from being harmed in their tomb, whether from grave robbers or evil spirits. Statues of powerful and mythical beasts were also used to offer protection in later dynasties. Ordinary people would not have a Spirit Way leading to their tomb.&bridges=Usually the <b>waterway</b>, whether natural or manmade, was found in front of the tomb. It had to be crossed by arched bridges. It was believed that flowing water brought good luck. By using arched bridges it supported the belief that hills offered protection.

&mound=The <b>mound</b> was a circular shape to represent the mountains where the immortals lived. The mound was directly above the burial chamber. The use of a mound would have been expected for an emperor's tomb. Often only wealthier people had a mound over their tomb because their families could afford the expense of building such a tomb. It would have been unlikely that poorer people would have had a mound over their tomb.&chamber1=The emperor's tomb at the site has not yet been excavated. However, a <b>burial chamber</b> of a wealthy person who worked for the emperor has been excavated.

&chamber2=Burial chambers varied in size from being a single <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/crypt.html','cryp')">crypt</a></font></u> to a series of connecting chambers. Other imperial tombs have been found with many chambers including courtyards, stable blocks and store rooms to make it as much like home as possible. The chambers were cut into rock in the North or dug into the earth in the South.

&chamber3=The wealthy used their tomb to parade their status and filled it with objects that would allow them to continue their life as it had been on Earth. During the Han dynasty jade products were placed on and in the bodies. Eye plaques were put over the eyes and an image of a <u><font color="#990000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/cicada.html','cica')">cicada</a></font></u> was put into the mouth. There were pots and storage jars for liquid and food. Representations of animals were placed in the tomb as food and for use in travel. Luxuries such as jade, lacquer ware and silks were also placed in tombs.

&chamber4=<B>Burial chamber</B><BR><BR>Emperors had an army to protect them, such as the Terracotta Army found at Qin Shi Huangdi's tomb near Xi'an. The wealthier in society had attendants to serve them. By early imperial times pottery and lacquered wooden attendant figures were placed with their master rather than live humans.

&buildings=<B>Buildings above ground</B><BR><BR>The number of buildings varied according to the status of the person buried. A wealthy family may offer worship to their ancestors at a single building, whereas a poor family would not have been able to afford a building. <br>To ensure a comfortable afterlife wealthy people sometimes paid for others to make offerings at their tombs regularly all year.

&hills=Tombs in the North were built with <b>hills</b> to the north. It was thought that this would protect the deceased from cold north and west winds, as well as from invaders from countries to the north of China. Tombs in the South were built into the ground with no protection from hills as the land is much flatter there.

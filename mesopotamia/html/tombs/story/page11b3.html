<b>Why did Woolley think the tombs were royal?</b>
<p>
In most of the other graves the dead person was wrapped in reed mats and surrounded by objects like pottery, cups and small amounts of jewellery. The 'royal' graves however,  had proper tomb chambers which were filled with objects made of gold, silver and precious stones.

<p>
The cylinder seal that Woolley found in one of the tombs is inscribed: "Pu-abi, nin".  The Sumerian word 'nin' can mean either lady or queen.
<p>
Bodies were discovered outside the burial chambers. They were dressed as soldiers and female attendants. The bodies were arranged as though they were protecting and entertaining the person who lay in the burial chamber.

Woolley needed a place to dump the rubble from clearing the ziggurat. He had to find an area of the site which had no buildings. To check, he dug two trenches.
<p>
In one of these trenches, he found the walls and floor of a building. This was a large courtyard surrounded by rooms. There was also a gate leading towards the ziggurat.
<p>
Woolley had to return to England before he could find out what the building was.

Woolley had to work out a puzzle. All Mesopotamian temples were given a  name. Bricks in the floor of this building were stamped with the name E-hur-sag. However, bricks in the walls were stamped with the name E-nun-mah. Which was right?

<p>
Woolley worked out that the a nearby building was E-hur-sag and that some spare bricks from it had been used to make a floor in E-nun-mah. 
<p>
Under one of the floors of E-nun-mah Woolley discovered a <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/h/hoard.html','hoard')">hoard</a> of jewellery. Was it a temple <a href="#" onClick="openGlos('../../glossary/o/offering.html','offering')">offering</a>, or had somebody buried it for some other reason?

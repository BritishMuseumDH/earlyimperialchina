              during the 6th and early 5th centuries BC. He travelled around different 
              Chinese kingdoms teaching ideas on how people should behave in society. 
              After his death his beliefs became popular. In the Han dynasty they 
              were written down by his followers in a book called The Analects. 
              Believers learned how to respect authority, be moderate and have 
              high levels of morality. Respect of authority depended on the different 
              types of relationships, e.g. emperor and subjects, husband or wife 
              or father and son (known as <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/filial.html','filia')">filial 
              piety</a>). <br>
              <br>
              Filial piety was important because it was the base for morality. 
              Morality came from education and following good examples in life. 
              Moderation came from respecting authority and having high morals. 
              Confucianism also included ancient beliefs in spirits, rivers and 
              the natural elements. Temples and family altars were some places 
              of worship. Descendants of the dead made offerings to their ancestors 
              hoping that they would bring them good fortune and protection. In 
              return this ensured that the dead had a fruitful afterlife. <br>

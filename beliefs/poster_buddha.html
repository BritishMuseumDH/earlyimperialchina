              Buddha comes in many different forms and deals with things such 
              as truth and kindness.Buddhism was introduced by Siddhartha Gautama, 
              who had been born into an Indian royal family in the 6th century 
              B.C. He became Buddha when he gave up his life to find Enlightenment 
              after he saw suffering and poverty. Buddhism found its way into 
              China along the Silk Road. The first record of Buddhism in China 
              is in A.D. 65. Texts about Buddhist beliefs were introduced into China 
              and translated in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D.Buddhism was most 
              popular in the Tang dynasty, despite Buddhist monks and nuns suffering 
              persecution in A.D. 845. <br>
              In China believers followed traditional Buddhist ideals including 
              meditation; rebirths eventually leading to Nirvana and having to 
              follow the sacred rules. </td>

            <td valign="top">To fit in with existing Confucian beliefs a change 
              was made to the relationship between husbands and wives. Instead 
              of respecting each other it became rephrased so a husband controls 
              his wife and a wife respects her husband. Worship would take place 
              in temples or places like the Cave of the Thousand Buddhas. Followers 
              would make offerings and pray to a particular image for guidance 
              or help. After death a believer is reincarnated until such time 
              as they have earned the right to be in Nirvana. </td>

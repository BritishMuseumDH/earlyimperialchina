&carousel2_text_1=<font face="Arial" size="14">The Great Wall was built by prisoners and conscripts. Conscripts came from the peasant class.

Nevertheless, conditions were so harsh that it is said for every 500m built a person died. </font face>



&carousel2_text_2=<font face="Arial" size="14">It was built to protect the Chinese from the nomadic tribes of the North and North West. Under the First Emperor existing walls built by the Qin, Zhao and Yan states were joined together to form the Great Wall. </font face>



&carousel2_text_3=<font face="Arial" size="14">As later dynasties gained control of more land they extended the wall to give themselves greater protection. The wall allowed the trade network to expand westward.</font face>

&carousel2_text_6=<font face="Arial" size="14">To protect China from invasion 2,500 garrisons and watchtowers were built along the entire length of the wall. They were established on sections of the wall which had been developed as the Silk Road expanded. In times of trouble these places could easily communicate to each other by beacon at night or by flag during the day. This picture shows a watchtower with the beams on the roof exposed. The beacon would be lit on the roof.</font face>



&carousel2_text_7=<font face="Arial" size="14">The Great Wall has been rebuilt several times. Its height has varied between 7 and 14 metres. At the base it was 10 metres in width and at the top it was 5-6 metres in width. The remains seen today are from the Ming dynasty. This section of the wall is at Badaling, northwest of Beijing.</font face>

<h3>Longbow</h3>

This type of bow was used by mounted archers because a crossbow was too difficult to load and fire from a horse. The technique used to fire the bow was known as the backward-shooting pose. The rider would face forward and then twist his upper body round to face backward and then shoot his bow in this position. 
<p>
Infantry men also used bows like these as an alternative to the crossbow when it became clear that the range of crossbow was limited in comparison to the longbow. In the Tang dynasty the ideal ratio of longbows to crossbows on the battlefield was five to one. In practice though it is not known how strictly this ratio was followed.

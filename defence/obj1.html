<h3>Armour pieces</h3>

This type of armour is known as lamellar and was based on the types of protection worn in Central Asia. It replaced earlier Chinese 'cord and plaque' armour towards the end of the Tang dynasty.  
<p>
A suit of lamellar armour would be made up of lots of pieces linked together. This would allow the person wearing it to move more easily than if they were wearing a suit of one-piece armour. Some lamellar armour found has been made of iron.

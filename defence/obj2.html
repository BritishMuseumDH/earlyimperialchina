<h3>Sword</h3>

The sword was an important weapon for close fighting and was used by both the cavalry and infantry. One use of swords in battle was to cut the heads off the enemy for trophies. 
<p>
This sword is made of iron. Iron gradually replaced the use of bronze throughout the Han dynasty as casting technology improved. The elaborate decoration on the scabbard suggests that this sword would have been owned by a wealthy person. Swords used by ordinary soldiers would have a simpler scabbard.

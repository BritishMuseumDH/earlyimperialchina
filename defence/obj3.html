<h3>Mounted archer</h3>


Usually this type of archer was used as a scout or skirmisher for the heavy cavalry and was based on the traditional Turkish weapon combination. The use of stirrups made it easier to balance on and control the horse. 
<p>
Mounted archers were used effectively in A.D. 617 in a battle that helped to end the Sui dynasty and led to the foundation of the Tang dynasty. A detachment of mounted archers and heavy cavalry forced the opposing leader to commit his troops early on in the battle. He was captured and his army defeated.

There were two types of infantry soldier in China - marching infantry, who used spears, and archers. Some carried shields, which differed in shape and size over time. In areas where great distances had to be covered mounted infantry were used. <BR><BR>The infantry were used with great effect in A.D. 1048 when they tunnelled under a city held by rebels and entered it. Once there, they let ropes down the walls for the rest of the army to climb up. The imperial army was successful because of the use of special units made up of prisoners.

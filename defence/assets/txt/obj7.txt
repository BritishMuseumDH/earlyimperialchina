obj7=<b>                    Crossbow</b><BR><BR>The crossbow was a Chinese invention. It was a key weapon of the Han army and was the reason why their armies were superior to the enemy.<br><br>An archer using an ordinary bow can only hold the bow drawn and ready to shoot for a short period of time. The crossbow uses a trigger mechanism to hold the arrows drawn, this meant the archer had time to aim and shoot.  It could have a range of over 200 metres whereas the range of an ordinary arrow is totally dependent on the strength of the archer's arms.

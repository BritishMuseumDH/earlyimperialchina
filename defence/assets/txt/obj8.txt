obj8=<b>                    Thumb Ring</b><BR><BR>A thumb ring would have been worn by longbow men as they had to draw the string and hold it in order to shoot an arrow. Crossbow men did not use thumb rings because they did not hold the tension on the string. In this case the string was held in place by a catch until released.<BR><BR> In the later dynasties thumb rings were worn as jewellery and this was reflected in their design. They were made of fine materials and were exquisitely decorated. This thumb ring is unlikely to have been used by an archer because it was made of jade and is well decorated.

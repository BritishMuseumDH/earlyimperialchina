<h3>Crossbow</h3>

This was a key weapon of the Han army and was the reason why their armies were superior to the enemy. It had a range of 200 metres. As the use of the longbow increased the crossbow became less effective. 
<p>
In A.D. 1207 at the battle of Xianyang 1,000 crossbowmen, along with 500 infantry, were used to repel a force of invading Ruzhen cavalry. Under the cover of darkness the Chinese attacked the enemy's camp with volleys of fire arrows and ordinary arrows. The Ruzhen were driven away. Later it was reported that the Ruzhen had lost about 2,500 men and 800 horses.

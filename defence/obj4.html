<h3>Cavalry</h3>

Heavy cavalry, where both the horse and rider are well protected by armour, emerged at the end of the Han dynasty. The horse is protected with a head guard and plate-like iron body armour. The rider is shown wearing a metal helmet and heavy cloak. His armour is not clear. 
<p>
Towards the end of the Northern Wei dynasty (A.D. 386-535) 'cord and plaque' armour appeared. This armour was made up of one-piece body shaped, iron plaques held together with cord. In later dynasties armour was made up of many pieces linked together.

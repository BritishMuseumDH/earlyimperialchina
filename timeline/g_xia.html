<h3>Xia Dynasty </h3>

<p>According to ancient historians there was a Xia dynasty before the Shang.  They are believed to have ruled an area around the Yellow River Basin from 2200 B.C. to around 1700 B.C.  The dynasty was said to have begun with the reign of Yu the Great.  He is famous for his battle against the floods on the Yellow River.  </p>

We still know very little about this dynasty as there is no written evidence from the period.
